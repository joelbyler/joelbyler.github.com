Recently I've started using vim for coding after over a decade of using IDE's for Java, VB, and C# projects.  I'll admit that I've been thinking about making the switch to vim for quite some time and it always seemed like a daunting task.

I decided to document the experience for the benefit of others and to remind myself that sometimes I just need to get out of my comfort zone and try things.

##Why would you want to use VIM?

  1. You don't need to use your mouse :)
  2. The flow of typing will is never interrupted (recompiling, validating, etc.)
  3. Remote pairing, I've spent many hours remote pairing on different projects while using a screen sharing tool like screen hero or skype. While those tools are great, they just don't work well in a low bandwidth scenario.  The combination of VIM and TMUX works well and is very fast.

##Why would you want to NOT use VIM?

I'm still looking into this. If you know of one, let me know!

##You don't need to dive in head first
One of my greatest concerns with starting to use vim was that I just knew that it would take me a lot of practice to get as proficient with it as I am with one of my old IDE's.  Then Atom.io came out in late February of this year.  All of my friends started using it and I found an early access invite so that I could see what all of the fuss was about.  Right away I realized that some of the keyboard shortcuts were different from what I was used to.  It wasn't that they were difficult to learn, its just that they're different.  Sometimes the differences were great enough that they caused me to bounce back into my old IDE for a while so I could get some more intense work down without thinking about what keys I'm using.  That's when it clicked for me, just because I want to try and use a different tool to edit my source code, it doesn't mean that I'm stuck with it for all time.  You're always free to jump back to your 'security blanket' where you're confortable when you need it.  Just don't feel like this means that you've failed, more drastic changes can take more time.  Keep in mind the benefits of the changes that you are trying to make.


##Fun ways to learn and practice
[VIM Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/) is a fun way to learn many useful VIM commands while playing through an RPG style interactive adventure.

[VIMGolf](http://vimgolf.com/) is a collection of different challenges which pit you against other golfers to find a way to complete a task using the minimum number of keystrokes.  After you submit your attempt, you're ranked against other players who've attempted the same challenge to see how well you fare.  You can also compare your submission with those who are close to you in ranking so you can learn from what some of the other challengers are doing.

##Pairing with someone who's done it for a while is a great way to learn
You'll find that there are lots of great plugins and tricks that you can pick up while pair programming with other developers that you would have never known about if you weren't working with them.  

[Tmate.io](http://tmate.io/) is a great tool to facilitate this task if you don't know of anyone close to you who's using VIM (or willing to pair with you).  It allows you to share a terminal session with many users.  Each user is able to type into the terminal so nobody gets excluded.  You can also find a pair to work with and lots of great resource on [PairProgramWith.me](http://pairprogramwith.me/).

##Watch for ways to make the experience better
At first you'll find that you feel like there is no efficient way to do anything when you're in vim.  It doesn't feel good at all.  Just remember this feeling, make sure you recognize it because you'll want to be able to recognize it when it happens less commonly in the future.  And then every time you get this feeling, look for a way to make it easier.  Ask you pair if they know of a way to perform the task which is easeir than you're trying.  Create your own custom key bindings for vim to complex and repetitive tasks. It will get easier, but always remember that feeling because as time goes on you will get more comfortable with your vim setup and less prone to recognize an inefficiency.
