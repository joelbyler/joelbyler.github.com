1.  Check cables, turn buckle, and other hardware for damage
1.  Check cover for damage (holes)
1.  Clean cover, suggested product: [Natural Chemistry Pool Cover Cleaner](http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Chemistry-00177-Cleaner-1-Quart/dp/B004VU8AMA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1399232541)
1.  Allow cover to dry, fold up and store for the season

**TIP:** Check out [Bug Ultra Strip repair kit](http://www.amazon.com/Bug-Solutions-Ultra-Strip-Repair/dp/B00B0J99TI/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1399236484) for winter cover repairs

## Filter Tank
### Lubricate O-rings
* large one around the lid
* smal one around the bleader valve
* even the drain plug has an o-ring, but only needs lubricated once every 3 years.
 
**WARNING:** do not use valisine! instead use [Lube Tube](http://www.amazon.com/Lube-Tube-Single-1oz-Each/dp/B004VTGLCC/ref=sr_1_5?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1399233368)

## Pump
### Lubricate O-rings
* librate large o-ring around the pump inlet
* o-ring around strainer housing lid

**NOTE:** There's a clip inside strainer housing to detach it from the pump.

## Filter
* clean with [Natural Chemistry 03215 Filter Perfect](http://www.amazon.com/Natural-Chemistry-Perfect-Discontinued-Manufacturer/dp/B002FB73ES/ref=sr_1_1?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1399233634) (if not cleaned already when the pool was closed in the fall)
* Filter perfect is good for 4 soaks (most if not all summer)
 
###Suggested cleaning cycle:
1. Mark flilter pressure gauge when filter is clean and pump is on high speed.
1. Once a week, turn pump on high speed and compare pressure against clean pressure mark.
1. If pressure raises 7 lbs., its time to clean the filter.  Typically this will be 17+ psi.
 
## Feeder
* lubricate o-ring around feeder cap
* lubricate o-ring on drain plug, but only needs lubricated once every 3 years.

## Inlet / pool light
